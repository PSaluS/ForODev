The plan was divided into 4 stages, differing in the nature of the tasks.

Stage 1.  Project and conception.
The first task will be purely conceptual, the challenges will be to make decisions and plan the scope of work.

- Plan the way of functioning during renovation.

Stage 2.  Organization of materials and preparation for work.
At this stage, the tasks will concern the acquisition of the required materials and preparation of the renovation site.
- Checking the availability and ordering the necessary elements (for example: building materials, new furniture, paints, panels, lighting).
- Selection of alternative items in case of availability problems.
- Removal of equipment that can be taken out from the room (for example, furniture, decorations).
- Securing stationary elements (for example: windows, doors).
